    <p><b>My first experience in AkiraChix was one that was the most memorable ones I've ever heard. One of the few good memories I have include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Interaction with people from different nationalities.</li>
        <li>Learning new languages and cultures</li>
        <li>Comfortale residential areas.</li>
        <li>Learning basic computer interactions.</li>
        <li>Having good delicacies during meal times.</li>
        <li>Strict schedules which has grown my self discipline</li>
    </ol>    
    <span>Despite the breathtaking memories, there is always a balance in the universe, which brings me to some of the things that i experienced that were not so good. Some of them include: </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Packed up and full hanging lines during laundry days on the weekends.</li>
        <li>Communication barriers between amongst the different nationalities due to different accents.</li>
        <li>Getting homesick and missing to see familiar faces.</li>
        <li>Getting a cold flu as a result of moving to a different geographical region with exactly opposite climatic conditions to the one I was used to.</li>
    </ul>
    <span>I did make a new friend. Her name is pepper, and she has the gift of lifting your moods whenever you're down.</span>
    <span>Meet Pepper......<img src="images/pexels-elif-tasli-889857993-19868767.jpg" width="200"> She wishes you a wonderful day.
